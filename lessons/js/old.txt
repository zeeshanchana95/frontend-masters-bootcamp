- JavaScript First Program: variable declaration

const montlyRent = 500; 
const yearlyRent = montlyRent * 12;
console.log(yearlyRent);  


- Program Flow:

const montlyRent = 500;

let yearlyRent = montlyRent * 12;
console.log(yearlyRent);  //2

yearlyRent = 1;
console.log(yearlyRent); //1


- How to print more than two values on same line?

const montlyRent = 500;
let yearlyRent = montlyRent * 12;
console.log(montlyRent, yearlyRent);  //2


- String Concatenation:

const firstName = "Zeeshan"
const lastName = "Ahmed"
const sentence = "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName + "! How are you? "; //string concatenation 

console.log(sentence); //Hello Zeeshan Ahmed! How are you?


- Template String:

const firstName = "Zeeshan"
const lastName = "Ahmed"

const sentence = `Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}! How are you?`;

console.log(sentence); //Hello Zeeshan Ahmed! How are you?
