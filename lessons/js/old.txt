- JavaScript First Program: variable declaration

const montlyRent = 500; 
const yearlyRent = montlyRent * 12;
console.log(yearlyRent);  


- Program Flow:

const montlyRent = 500;

let yearlyRent = montlyRent * 12;
console.log(yearlyRent);  //2

yearlyRent = 1;
console.log(yearlyRent); //1


- How to print more than two values on same line?

const montlyRent = 500;
let yearlyRent = montlyRent * 12;
console.log(montlyRent, yearlyRent);  //2


- String Concatenation:

const firstName = "Zeeshan"
const lastName = "Ahmed"
const sentence = "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName + "! How are you? "; //string concatenation 

console.log(sentence); //Hello Zeeshan Ahmed! How are you?


- Template String:

const firstName = "Zeeshan"
const lastName = "Ahmed"

const sentence = `Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}! How are you?`;

console.log(sentence); //Hello Zeeshan Ahmed! How are you?



/**
 * strings:
 *  - bunch of characters sitting next to each other
 *  - used for storing literal values like any word, sentence
 *  - value need to be enclosed inside Single Quotes '', Double Quotes "", or Backticks `` 
 * 
 * Syntax Error: 
 *  - means your grammar is bad, fix it
 *  - pretty easy to fix
 * 
 * String Concatenation:
 *  - connecting strings together
 *  - use + symbol to combine strings together
 */

const firstName = "Zeeshan"
const lastName = "Ahmed"

const sentence = `Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}! How are you?`;

console.log(sentence);









- Using Booleans:
const isSkyBlue = true;
console.log(isSkyBlue); //true



- Primitive Types: Number
const num = 10;
const num2 = 10.222;
const num3 = - 0.5;

console.log(num, num2, num3);


/**
 * Control Flow: 
 * - if-else statements
 * - ask questions inside if(question) and question has to be true or false
 * - block: whatever inside {} and ends when bracket ends } ends
 * - helps do conditional logic
 * 
 */

//like to make boolean questions, get the idea it is boolean
const isSkyBlue = true;

let greeting;

if(isSkyBlue) {
    greeting = "It must be nice weather"
    //execute if true
} else {
   greeting = "It must be not nice weather";//executes if false
}
